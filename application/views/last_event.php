	        In the start of our journey, we plan to set our tone and begin the publicity of our motives. With the idea to trigger the realization of the community in the passion of the youth, and to educate more on grit and determination. On september 23rd, We coordinated together with queenshead and collected unique personalities to speak up and to color our society with their experience. We had hoped to arrange an event that was set to open the eyes and the minds of the unaware, and ultimately to deliver a sense. to see, a to feel and to relate.
